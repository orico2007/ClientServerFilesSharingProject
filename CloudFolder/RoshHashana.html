                    Rosh Hashanah, literally "head of the year," is the Jewish New Year.
                    The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah, "day of shouting/blasting."
                    It is the first of the Jewish High Holy Days, as specified by Leviticus 23:23–25, that occur in the late summer/early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere.
                    Rosh Hashanah begins a ten-day period of penitence culminating in Yom Kippur,
                    as well as beginning the cycle of autumnal religious festivals running through Sukkot and ending in Shemini Atzeret in Israel and in Simchat Torah everywhere else.

                    Rosh Hashanah is a two-day observance and celebration that begins on the first day of Tishrei,
                    the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. In contrast to the ecclesiastical lunar new year on the first day of the first month Nisan,
                    the spring Passover month that marks Israel's exodus from Egypt, Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the civil year, according to the teachings of Judaism.
                    It is the traditional anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman according to the Hebrew Bible, as well as the initiation of humanity's role in God's world.

                    Rosh Hashanah customs include sounding the shofar, a hollowed-out ram's horn, as prescribed in the Torah.
                    Its rabbinical customs include attending synagogue services and reciting special liturgy about teshuva, as well as enjoying festive meals.
                    Eating symbolic foods, such as apples dipped in honey, hoping to evoke a sweet new year, is an ancient tradition recorded in the Talmud.

            Rosh is the Hebrew word for "head," ha is the definite article ("the"), and shana means year. Thus, Rosh HaShanah means "head of the year," referring to the Jewish New Year.
            The term Rosh Hashanah in its current meaning does not appear in the Torah. Leviticus 23:24 refers to the festival of the first day of the seventh month as zikhron teru'ah ("a memorial of blowing [of horns]"),
            and Numbers 29:1 calls the festival yom teru'ah ("day of blowing [the horn]").
            The term Rosh Hashanah appears once in the Bible (Ezekiel 40:1), where it has a different meaning: either generally the time of the "beginning of the year," or possibly a reference to Yom Kippur, or to the month of Nisan.
            In the Jewish prayer-books (the Siddur and Machzor), Rosh Hashanah is also called Yom Hazikaron (the day of remembrance), not to be confused with the modern Israeli remembrance day of the same name.
